## Task 2 : Phishing Exercise for TBFC

This task begin with some Terminology:

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Social Engineering | **Social engineering** refers to manipulating a user to make a mistake. Examples of such mistakes include sharing a password, opening a malicious file, and approving a payment. The term “social” means that the target of such an attack is human beings, not computer systems. Consequently, the attacker relies on psychological tricks to get the target user to cooperate. Some psychological factors that can play a key role in the success of such attacks are urgency, curiosity, and authority. This is why some would refer to social engineering as “human hacking”. |
| Phishing           | Phishing is a subset of social engineering in which the communication medium is mostly messages. At one point, the most common phishing attacks happened via email; however, the spread of smartphones, along with ubiquitous Internet access, has spread phishing to short text messages (smishing), voice calls (vishing), QR codes (quishing), and social-media direct messages. The attacker’s purpose is to make the target user click, open, or reply to a message so that the attacker can steal information, money, or access.                                            |

TBFC cyber security awareness training teaches users about two anti-phishing mnemonics written as S.T.O.P. The first S.T.O.P. is from [All Things Secured,](https://www.allthingssecured.com/tips/email-phishing-scams-stop-method/) which tells users to ask the following questions before acting on an email:
- **Suspicious**?
- **Telling me** to click something?
- **Offering me** an amazing deal?
- **Pushing me** to do something now?

The second S.T.O.P. reminds users to follow the following instructions:
- **Slow down**. Scammers run on your adrenaline.
- **Type the address yourself**. Don’t use the message’s link.
- **Open nothing unexpected**. Verify first.
- **Prove the sender**. Check the real From address/number, not just the display name.
### Building the trap
in this step we will try to acquire a user login credentials using a crafted phishing email. For that we need to host it and implement some logic to capture the credentials entered by the target.

inside the attack box provided by THM we have the following file :
- server.py : Socket server listening on port 8000
- index.html : website

when running the script `server.py` :

The `0.0.0.0` implies that it is bound to all interfaces.

we can view the site in a web browser using the url : `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260126220557.png)

our phishing site is up and running.
### Delivery via Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)
now that our bait is set up and running we need to attach it to the blade in other words send it to the victim.

first we need to create a fake legitimate email from where we will send the phishing email so the email will appear to be coming from a legitimate-looking sender. The more a phishing email appears realistic, the more likely it is for the target user to believe it and get phished.

in order to send a realistic-looking email that contains our fake login page we can use the [Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit) tool.

Since this tool is available in the attack box i will just have to type `setoolkit` :
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260126221617.png)

there we can choose between a variety of option, our desired one is the first option.

then:

it will prompt us with a multitude of type of social engineering attacks in our case we will use the option 5.

then:

Now, we would be asked to select between two options. One option allows us to send the phishing email to a single address, while the other option enables us to send an email to many people. Here, we would select option `1`, i.e., `E-Mail Attack Single Email Address`.

after that questions will have to be answered :
- **Send email to**: Let’s begin by targeting `factory@wareville.thm`
- **How to deliver the email**: We will choose `Use your own server or open relay`
- **From address**: We know that the guys at the toy factory communicate regularly with Flying Deer, the shipping company, so that we will use `updates@flyingdeer.thm` as the source email address
- **From name**: Let’s use the name `Flying Deer`
- **Username for open-relay**: We will leave it blank and just hit the **Enter** key
- **Password for open-relay**: We will leave it blank and just hit the **Enter** key
- **SMTP email server address**: We will deliver directly to the TBFC mail server by entering `10.80.134.45`.
- **Port number for the SMTP server**: We leave the default value of `25` and just hit the **Enter** key
