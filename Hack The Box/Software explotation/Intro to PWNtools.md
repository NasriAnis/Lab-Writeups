### whats PWNtools
Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible. [Pwntools Github page here.](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

The other tool we will be using is pwndbg, which is "a GDB plug-in that makes debugging with GDB suck less, with a focus on features needed by low-level software developers, hardware hackers, reverse-engineers and exploit developers" ([pwndbg Github page](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg)).

Lastly, if you would like to download the challenges from this room to use on your own machine, you can find them (and my solutions) on my Github: [https://github.com/dizmascyberlabs/IntroToPwntools](https://github.com/dizmascyberlabs/IntroToPwntools).
